# AdaBoostTrees
A adaboost implementation with decision trees in pure python.

More elaborated can be found [in this blog](https://simsicon.wordpress.com/2016/08/05/understanding-decision-tree-learning-4/), a chapter of a series on decision tree.

This code is intended for education and research, not recommended for production usage, due to its lack of optimation. However, any suggestions are welcome.
